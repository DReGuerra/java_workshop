This workshop is currently being developed. Below is a list of contents that will be expanded. The topics in each of these sections are not exhaustive of the entirety of the Java language. I will try to fill out the "meat" of the contents first, and once the workshop has taken more shape, I will start to polish existing content and add more advanced topics/features.

## Contents
0. Getting started
1. Developing in Java
2. Programming basics
3. Flow control
4. Classes
5. Inheritance
6. Polymorphism
7. Abstract classes
8. Exception handling
9. Interfaces

## Getting started
Before getting started coding in Java you will need an integrated development environment (IDE). There are a variety of possible options to be used (e.g., [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), [NetBean](https://netbeans.apache.org/), [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org/), etc.). I will use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Follow the links and download the IDE you are most interested in. 

Now that you downloaded an IDE, you need to download Java. Java Standard Edition (SE) 18 is the latest version, while Java SE 17 is the long term support (LTS) version. You will need to download Java SE 17 or 18 and the Java Development Kit (JDK) 18 that accompanies them. The JDK contains the development environemnt with which Java programs can be developed. You can download these on the Oracle [website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java18).

## Developing in Java
There are several benefits for developing in Java. One of the most important ones is Java's handgling of the program from high-level code (the Java code itself) down to low-level code (machine code) which the compute executes. Generally, programming languages translate the high-level code to low-level code via a compiler. The compiler converts your high-level code directly to the machine code of your computer. The problem is that different computers use different machine languages, which means to run your program in different computers you need to compile it with different compilers. Java solves this problem through the implementation of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 

The JVM compiles your high-level Java code to byte-code. Byte-code is the machine language of a JVM. A JVM is a virtual JAVA computer that is running inside your computer (comes from the JDK that we downloaded in the previous section). Now, since the JVMs running on all computers that download the JDK are the same, the byte-code is tranferable between computers. Finally, the JDK will also perform a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiling of the byte-code. This happens as the compiler converts the byte-code to machine code chuck by chuck throughout the execution of the program (just-in-time).

## Programming basics
TODO:
- main
- output to console via System.out
- printing (println and printf)
- variables vs constants and their assignments
- types
- 

## Flow control
TODO: 
- for loops
- if else statements
-
## Classes
TODO:
- concept of a class
- objects
- instances
- constructors
- attributes
- methods

## Inheritance
TODO:
- concept of a child class
- inheritance from parent class

## Polymorphism

## Abstract classes

## Exception handling
TODO:
- try-catch-throw
-

## Interfaces
