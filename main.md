This workshop is currently being developed. Below is a list of contents that will be expanded. The topics in each of these sections are not exhaustive of the entirety of the Java language. I will try to fill out the "meat" of the contents first, and once the workshop has taken more shape, I will start to polish existing content and add more advanced topics/features.

## Contents
0. Getting started
1. Developing in Java
2. Programming basics
3. Flow control
4. Classes
5. Inheritance
6. Polymorphism
7. Abstract classes
8. Exception handling
9. Interfaces

## Getting started
Before getting started coding in Java you will need an integrated development environment (IDE). There are a variety of possible options to be used (e.g., [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), [NetBean](https://netbeans.apache.org/), [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org/), etc.). I will use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Follow the links and download the IDE you are most interested in. 

Now that you downloaded an IDE, you need to download Java. Java Standard Edition (SE) 18 is the latest version, while Java SE 17 is the long term support (LTS) version. You will need to download Java SE 17 or 18 and the Java Development Kit (JDK) 18 that accompanies them. The JDK contains the development environemnt with which Java programs can be developed. You can download these on the Oracle [website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java18).

## Developing in Java


TODO:
- byte-code
- JVM
- just in time (JIT) compiling

## Programming basics
TODO:
- main
- output to console via System.out
- printing (println and printf)
- variables vs constants and their assignments
- types
- 

## Flow control
TODO: 
- for loops
- if else statements
-
## Classes
TODO:
- concept of a class
- objects
- instances
- constructors
- attributes
- methods

## Inheritance
TODO:
- concept of a child class
- inheritance from parent class

## Polymorphism

## Abstract classes

## Exception handling
TODO:
- try-catch-throw
-

## Interfaces
