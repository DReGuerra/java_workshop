Description: \
This repositiory contains a workshop on Java programming language features and object-oriented programming (OOP) methods. The goal of this workshop is to provide readers/users with a basic overview of Java programming language and some examples of OOP concepts and methods. Some of the examples will be general in nature to illustrate features and topics discussed, but I will also develop some engineering specific example scripts demonstrating the usage of OOP and other features of Java. 

This repository is based on my experience programming in Java (which is limited to undergraduate studies), and on a variety of online resources (e.g., StackExchange, stackoverflow). Most of the concepts and features discussed can be found in most searchable online resources.

## Branches
Currently, this repository will be developed on the `master` branch only. I don't see the need for secondary branches at the moment. If this changes, I will update this section.
